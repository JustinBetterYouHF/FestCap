# FestCap

This is an app used to track the capacity of venues at a festival. 

Users will be able to see all available venues at a festival and how much space is left. 

Admins(door trackers) will be keeping the head count in each venue which will be linked to a real time database that is displayed on the user side. 

The backend will be developed using Firebase.
